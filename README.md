# Platform PoC

This repository is a **proof-of-concept Internal Developer Platform** built with [Backstage](https://backstage.io).  
It demonstrates how to extend Backstage with custom frontend and backend plugins, integrate with a **PostgreSQL database**, and orchestrate **k6 performance test runs on Kubernetes**.  

The stack showcases modern platform engineering practices including **TypeScript/Node.js, React, Docker, Kubernetes, GitOps with ArgoCD, and Microsoft OIDC authentication**.  

The goal of this PoC is to explore how Backstage can **streamline developer workflows**, **centralize service visibility**, and provide a **foundation for scalable internal platforms**.
